## 📐 Growth Comparison Model – Why You Shouldn't Compare Yourself

This simple Python model visualizes why comparing your journey to others is mathematically flawed.

We define:
- **Your Growth:** `P(t) = a · ln(t + 1)`
- **Their Growth:** `O(t) = b · ln(t + 1 + c)`
- **Comparison Error:** `E(t) = |P(t) - O(t)|`

### 🔍 What it shows:
- Different people have different rates and head starts.
- The comparison error `E(t)` never truly disappears.
- So, focus on your path — not theirs.

📊 Built with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib  
🎯 Inspired by the idea that math can explain personal growth
